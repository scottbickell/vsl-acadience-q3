In Partnership to Support Student Literacy and Math

Dear %%first_name%%,

We are pleased to announce Voyager Sopris Learning® and Acadience Learning™ have an expanded partnership to deliver Acadience’s powerful and effective preK–high school assessment tools throughout the United States. Voyager Sopris Learning will continue to serve as the exclusive print distributor for Acadience Reading and Acadience Math assessments.

To support educators as they help students acquire essential literacy skills, the partnership enables Voyager Sopris Learning to offer a suite of literacy assessment solutions that include Acadience Reading K–6, Acadience Reading Survey, and Acadience Reading Diagnostic: Comprehension, Fluency &amp; Oral Language, previously published as DIBELS® Next, DIBELS® Deep, and DIBELS® Survey respectively.

These are the same assessment tools you know and trust, authored by researchers Dr. Roland Good and Dr. Ruth Kaminski. They feature quick, reliable, and valid measures for all students, including those with dyslexia, that indicate if they are on track for reading success and pinpoint where they are struggling.
